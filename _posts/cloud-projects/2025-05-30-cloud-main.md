### Objective
In IT342 - Cloud Administration, our projects simulated configuring a secure cloud application for a business. We were supposed to do this for the 3 major cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and Google, but we were not assigned an AWS project during the course unfortunately.

# [Azure Project](/posts/cloud-azure)

**Features used**: virtual networks (VNets), network security groups (NSG), identity and access management (IAM), private endpoints, private DNS zones

# [GCP Project](/posts/cloud-gcp)

**Features used**: buckets, virtual private clouds (VPC), compute engine (VM deployment), network security (firewall rules), autoscaling policies, health checks, BigQuery

### Learning Outcomes

- Designed secure cloud networks using Azure VNets and GCP VPCs

- Implemented least-privilege access controls using IAM and firewall policies

- Secured cloud services using private endpoints, private DNS, and network segmentation

- Applied availability concepts such as autoscaling and health checks

- Implemented CIS Benchmarks across different cloud environments
