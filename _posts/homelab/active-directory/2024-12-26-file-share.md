description: Setting up a simple file share in an Active Directory environment.

### Note

This exercise assumes you have completed the initial Active Directory setup.

You must have a functioning Domain Controller and at least 1 Windows client joined to the domain.

The Domain Controller and Windows client should be able to communicate with each other (you can test this with pings)

### Install File Services

On the DC VM, head to the Server Manager Dashboard

Click **Manage > Add Roles and Features**

Click on next until you get to Server Roles

The File Server should be installed by default, if not, go through the installation wizard

### Creating the Share

Our DC VM will act as the file server

On the C:\ of the DC, create a folder called Shares

![2](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/3.png){: width="400" height="200" }

Right click on the new folder and head to **Properties > Sharing > Advanced Sharing**

Make sure **Share this folder** is checked
 
Click on Permissions belkow comments

![3](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/3.png){: width="400" height="200" }

Allow full control , change, and read permissions for everyone

![4](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/4.png){: width="400" height="200" }

Within the Shares folder, create some additional folders

I created Administrators, Finance, HR, and IT to simulate different roles in a corporate environment

![5](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/5.png){: width="800" height="400" }

### Creating Security Groups

Now we will create security groups for these different roles so that they can access the appropriate shares (Administrators should get access to the Administrators share, IT should get access to the IT share, etc.)

Head to AD Users and Computers

Create a new OU for security groups (**Action > New > Organizational Unit**)

Under security groups, create another OU for shared folders

Right Click **Shared Folders > New > Group**

This group will be for the Admins

I named it SF-Administrators 

Set the scope to global and the group type to security

Follow the same process and create security groups for Finance, HR and IT, keeping the SF naming convention

![6](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/6.png){: width="800" height="400" }

Once all the groups are created, right click on one of the groups and head to **Properties > Members > Add**

In this case, I am editing SF-Administrators 

![7](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/7.png){: width="800" height="400" }

Enter the name of a valid AD user and click Check Names

You may also add the Administrator and Domain Admins as members

Click OK

![8](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/8.png){: width="400" height="200" }

Apply

![9](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/9.png){: width="400" height="200" }

This is my setup:

**Trent:** Admin

**Bob:** IT and Finance

**Alice:** IT and HR

![10](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/10.png){: width="400" height="200" }

Right click the shares folder from the C drive and go to **Properties > Security > Advanced**

Next to Owner, click on Change

Set the object owner to SF-Administrators and click OK

![11](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/11.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Click disable inheritance

Select convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object

![12](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/12.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Make sure you are still on the permissions tab

Remove every principal except SYSTEM

![13](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/13.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Then, Add new principles

Click **Select a principle** 

Add SF-Administrators, click Check Names and OK

![14](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/14.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Under basic permissions, check Full control permissions and click OK

![15](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/15.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Add another principal

Click **Select a principle** and add Domain Users, click Check Names and OK

Under basic permissions, click Clear all and only select read & execute, list folder contents, and read

Click OK

![16](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/16.png){: width="600" height="400" }

The permissions tab for the Shares folder should look like this

![17](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/17.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Head to C:\Shares\ (you should see the Admins, Finance, HR, and IT folders)

Right click the Administrators folder > **Properties > Security > Advanced**

Remove Domain Users from the list of principals and disable inheritance

Click OK

![18](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/18.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Right click the Finance folder > **Properties > Security > Advanced**

Change the folder owner to SF-Administrators

Make sure SYSTEM and SF-Administrators have full control permissions

Remove Domain Users if they are under the list of principals

Make sure inheritance is disabled (the Enable inheritance button should show)

Then click Add a principal

![19](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/19.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Click select a principal and add SF-Finance

Click Show advanced permission on the right hand side to display the advanced permissions options

Click on full control, then uncheck the following permissions: Delete, Change permissions, Take ownership

These permissions make sure that members of the Finance security group can create, delete, and modify files within the Finance share, but not delete the Finance share itself

Click OK

![20](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/20.png){: width="700" height="400" }

The permissions tab for the Finance share should look like this

![21](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/21.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Follow same process for the rest of the shares. Each share should have SYSTEM and SF-Administrators as the principal with full control permissions, and the respective security group with special permissions.

This is what the Administrators share looks like

Nobody should be able to view the contents of the Administrators share except members of SF-Administrators

![22](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/22.png){: width="600" height="400" }

### Deploying the File Share via GPO

Head to Group Policy Management on the DC VM

Go to **Forest > Domains > Domain Name > Group Policy Objects** 

Right click **Group Policy Objects > New**

Name the GPO Mapped Drives and double click the new GPO from the left side bar

![23](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/23.png){: width="800" height="400" }

Right click the Shares folder on File Explorer and head to **Properties > Sharing** 

Remember the NetBIOS issue I mentioned during the initial setup? The listed Network Path (\\\\DOMAINCONTROLLE\Shares) is incorrect because the NetBIOS name of the DC is technically different from the hostname.

The hostname of the DC is DomainController

![24](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/24.png){: width="200" height="200" }

However, the Network Path is listed as \\\\DOMAINCONTROLLE\Shares because the NetBIOS name of this machine is DOMAINCONTROLLE

AD clients will refer to the DC with its hostname, not the NetBIOS name.

The correct network path is \\\\DomainController\Shares in my situation

Again, DomainController is a bad computer name because of the length and case sensitivity of the NetBIOS naming convention

![25](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/25.png){: width="400" height="200" }

On Group Policy Management, right click the Mapped Drives GPO and click Edit

Head to **User Configuration > Preferences > Windows Settings**

![26](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/26.png){: width="600" height="400" }

Right click Drive Maps, **New > Mapped Drive**

Enter the proper Network Path of the share into the Location box

Check Reconnect

Label as Shares

I used the S drive letter

Leave no change for hide/show this drive and hide/show all drives

Click Apply and OK

![27](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/27.png){: width="400" height="200" }

Drag the Mapped Drives GPO to the Domain

Click OK to link the GPO to the Domain

![28](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/28.png){: width="800" height="400" }

On Mapped Drives, under links, the domain should appear under location with link eneabled

![29](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/29.png){: width="800" height="400" }

### Testing

Log into one of the client VMs (Bob or Alice)

Make sure network discovery is turned on 

>To turn enable network discovery, open Control Panel, head to **Network and Sharing Center > Advanced sharing settings,** and then in the Network discovery section, select **Turn on network discovery** and save the changes
{: .prompt-info }

We should see the share (\\\\DomainController or S:)

![30](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/30.png){: width="800" height="400" }

Notice that we canâ€™t access the Administrators share as Bob or Alice since they are not in the Administrators group

![31](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/31.png){: width="800" height="400" }

As Bob, I am able to access the IT share and create a new file

![32](/assets/img/cyberlab/active-directory/file-share/32.png){: width="800" height="400" }

We now have a functioning file share with proper security groups
